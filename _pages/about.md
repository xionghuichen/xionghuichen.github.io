<p>
Currently, I am a Researcher at the Qwen Team.  

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm">Nanjing University</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy/">Yang Yu</a>, and as a member of the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx">LAMDA Group</a>, led by Prof. <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/index.htm">Zhi-Hua Zhou</a>.  

Before my doctoral studies, I received my B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering from <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm">Southeast University</a> in 2018. In September 2018, I was admitted to pursue an M.Sc. degree at <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/main.htm">Nanjing University</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/yuy/">Yang Yu</a>. I continued my research as a Ph.D. student from September 2020.  

From October 2023, I have been a visiting researcher in the UK, working with Prof. <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/yali-du">Yali Du</a> at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/">Kingâ€™s College London</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/">Jun Wang</a> at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>.

**Research Interests:**  
My research focuses on addressing challenges in applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to real-world problems. In particular, I am interested in sim-to-real transfer, offline RL, causal inference for RL, and real-world environment reconstruction. I also work on developing RL policies for applications such as autonomous driving, recommender systems, robotics, and industrial control systems. More recently, my research has expanded to large-scale foundation model training.
